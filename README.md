# 🧠 AI-Powered Real-Time Health Monitoring Dashboard

This project is a Flask-based web app that simulates and displays real-time health metrics from wearable devices. It performs basic anomaly detection and provides visualizations for:

- Heart Rate (bpm)
- Blood Oxygen Level (SpO₂ %)
- Physical Activity Level (METs)



## 🚀 Features

✅ Real-time display of health metrics  
✅ Anomaly detection with alerts (e.g., low SpO₂, irregular HR)  
✅ Interactive historical charts using Chart.js  
✅ Easy to run on Google Colab or locally
